# Hybrid ETL/ELT Pipeline for Data Lake & Data Warehouse

## üöÄ Project Overview
This project models a professional data engineering solution by designing and implementing a robust pipeline that handles both **Extract, Transform, Load (ETL)** and **Extract, Load, Transform (ELT)** processes. The data is ingested from various sources, stored raw in a **Data Lake (Simulated S3/MinIO)**, and then transformed and loaded into a structured **Data Warehouse (PostgreSQL/ClickHouse)** for analytical queries.

This demonstrates deep skills in data architecture, pipeline orchestration, and handling diverse data storage solutions.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Technologies
* **Python:** Data transformation logic (Pandas).
* **Airflow / Prefect:** Pipeline orchestration and scheduling.
* **Docker Compose:** To run the orchestrator, Data Lake (MinIO), and Data Warehouse (PostgreSQL) services.
* **SQL/dbt (Optional):** For Transform (T) logic within the Data Warehouse (ELT approach).
* **Parquet/Delta:** Optimized storage formats in the Data Lake.

## üìã Project Scope and Deliverables
1.  **Architecture Design:** Designing a Star/Snowflake schema for the analytical Data Warehouse.
2.  **Service Setup:** Defining a `docker-compose.yml` that links all services (Orchestrator, Lake, Warehouse).
3.  **ETL/ELT Pipeline:** Implementing a workflow (DAG in Airflow) with the following stages:
    * **Source:** Extracting data from simulated CSV/API sources.
    * **Lake Load:** Loading raw data as Parquet files into the MinIO Data Lake.
    * **Transformation:** Applying cleaning and business logic (either in Python (ETL) or using SQL within the Warehouse (ELT)).
    * **Warehouse Load:** Finalizing the clean, structured data into the PostgreSQL tables.
4.  **Testing:** Implementing basic data quality checks (DQ) at key pipeline stages.

## üìä Results and Benchmarks
The pipeline successfully processes and reconciles [NUMBER] million records across [NUMBER] different sources. The structured data in the Data Warehouse allows for analytical queries to run in under [TIME] seconds, supporting business intelligence needs.

## üèÉ Getting Started
1.  Start all services: `docker-compose up -d`
2.  Access the orchestrator UI (Airflow/Prefect) at `http://localhost:[PORT]`.
3.  Manually trigger the main ETL/ELT DAG and monitor its stages.
